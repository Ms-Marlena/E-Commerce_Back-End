## Description
This project enables the user to perform CRUD operations with a database of products, organizing them by category, product name, and tags. This is a common need for sites that sell goods, and need some way to track inventory, change prices, and search for specific products. 
I learned how to connect to an API, use SQL to  build routes, and test routes using Insomnia Core. 

## Installation & Usage
Because this is a back-end, the user must install the dependencies and run the server. From there you can use sequelize to open the database in MySQL, and/or open the database in Insomnia Core to test the different routes.
